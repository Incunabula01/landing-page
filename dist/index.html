                            And we have begun to prepare for an unstoppable $100 trillion American meltdown that will be unleashed in its aftermath.

                            Unfortunately, our government has already enacted measures for this coming catastrophe as well. They call it "The Day After Plan."

                            Because our leaders have kept you in the dark about this dangerous situation, I'm going to release all of the evidence my team has gathered.

                            This way you can see it for yourself.
